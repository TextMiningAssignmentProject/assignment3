\uc601\uc0c1\uac00\uc0ac[Intro]Yeah, yeah, yeah\u200b[Verse 1]People say there's more to lifeThan getting rich and walking rightGraduate from nine to fiveSit and watch the time go byI don't really know, that may be it allIt could be the whole thingI do what I want, I go where I pleaseBut still I want more thingsI let lost people run my lifeSing these songs, it's all I gotLost myself to a part I playNow I'm just sad and my head hurtAin't no wet foot, I go head firstHit the fork and I took a left turnLearning that I had to do it my wayAnd before it gets bett\u0435r, it's gonna get worse\u200b[Chorus]You bett\u0435r live for the right nowAnd throw a smile on your faceThe good things in your life nowDo not let them go to wasteIf I could give you some advice nowAppreciate what you haveBecause if you lost it all right nowI betcha you'd be in your bagGirl you better bask in that daylightMomma told me \"Boy, fix your face rightAnd if you keep whining, I promise, I'll give you good reason to cry\"Life's short don't waste timeGot a good girl gotta make timeGotta throw the ego to the waysideShow love, you ain't gotta say why, nawDon't waste timeGot a good girl gotta make timeGotta throw the ego to the waysideShow love, you ain't gotta say why, no, no\u200b[Verse 2]I used to want to be up on the music blogsI used to want to sign a deal with InterscopeI used to want to be up in the illest carsWith the baddest women and the illest hoesAnd the mad Benz, on the cal, with the ceiling offLooking at my ex-girl, walking as I'm peeling offCamera pan close up on her face and she's still in aweI may not have a million but I'm chillin' dawgAnd if I could go back, I would say to him\"Just focus on your spirit and you'll make it kidAnd do right by the women that you make it withTaking her for granted, she's someone you should be patient withGet your momma flowers, even when she get you mad madAnd people backstab, be careful and keep a trash bagSkip the fast pass, be knowledgeable, that's the bag bagPolish all your skills, set your price, then you tax thatEven if you independent no man is an islandAnd do not put your stock in fresh trends and diamondsAnd if you treat her good she won't think about your walletYou could put a rock on her finger don't make you solid\"\u200b[Chorus]You better live for the right nowAnd throw a smile on your faceThe good things in your life nowDo not let them go to wasteIf I could give you some advice nowAppreciate what you haveBecause if you lost it all right nowI betcha you'd be in your bagGirl you better bask in that daylightMomma told me \"Boy, fix your face rightAnd if you keep whining, I promise, I'll give you good reason to cry\"Life's short don't waste timeGot a good girl gotta make timeGotta throw the ego to
